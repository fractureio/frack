      An implementation of the proposed NWSGI (.NET Web Server Gateway Interface) written in F#.
    </div>

    <p>Frack
============
Frack is an implementation of the proposed NWSGI (.NET Web Server Gateway Interface), which has a similar intent as the [Python WSGI](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/) and [JSGI](http://jackjs.org/jsgi-spec.html) specifications. Frack is similar in implementation to [Rack](http://rack.rubyforge.org/) and [Jack](http://jackjs.org/) and owes a lot to those projects.

Frack is developed in [F#](http://fsharp.net) as it most directly correlates to the Python and JavaScript implementations and provides yet another opportunity to show off the power and elegance of a terrific language.

Goals
============
1. Provide a simple, to-the-metal framework for quickly building web applications without a lot of hassle. Frack will run on top of [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) or [System.Net.HttpListener](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.httplistener.aspx).
2. Provide a similar interface to those already available on other platforms for easier interoperability with those platforms/applications.
3. Provide a means of using Frack apps as middlewares for other multi-tier applications, similar to [Rack middleware](http://tekpub.com/production/rack).
4. Allow easy deployment on a range of servers: IIS via ASP.NET, [Kayak](http://kayakhttp.com), etc.

Usage
============

### Define an app

Takes an environment and returns a triple of status code, headers, and body.
    
    > let app env =
    >   ( 200, dict [| ("Content-Type","text/plain");("Content-Length","5") |], seq { yield "Howdy" } )
    
    val app : IDictionary<string,Value> -> int * IDictionary<string,string> * seq<string>

### Define a middleware

Takes an app and returns an app.

    > open Frack.Utility
    > fun env -> let status, hdrs, body = app env
    >            match env?HTTP_METHOD with
    >              | Str "HEAD" -> ( status, hdrs, Seq.empty )
    >              | _ -> ( status, hdrs, body )

    val head : (IDictionary<string,Value> -> int * IDictionary<string,string> * seq<string>) -> IDictionary<string,Value> -> int * IDictionary<string,string> * seq<string>

### Add middlewares to an app.

    > let myApp = app >> head >> auth >> logging
    
    val myApp : IDictionary<string,Value> -> int * IDictionary<string,string> * seq<string>
